Hello Odin!

I present to you my landing page! 

This is a realtor landing page inspired by Spongebob Squarepants' episode of "That's No Lady" S04EP27, where Patrick Star was approached by a stranger telling him to "GET OUTTA TOWN!" This page is expected to appeal to those who are planning to relocate, specifically out of their current town, hence the business name.

This landing page is just for fun, NOT for any form of profit, and all images and references are NOT my original work. They are to be credited to Nickelodeon and its creators and artists of the Spongebob Squarepants series.

I put a lot of effort into this fun project and hope you enjoy it. Thank you for viewing and thank you Spongebob for existing throughout my childhood! &#128156;
